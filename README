Code modified from https://github.com/cataliniacob/calibre-recipes.

Changes from original:

  - Added 2017 question
  - Added multiple OS support
  - Generated books to download

Recipes for Calibre (http://calibre-ebook.com/).

For the Edge.org annual question the recipes are generated automatically from
a general template in order to get a separate book for each year. Simply
running all-edgeorg-annual-questions-books.py will generate all books from
1998 to the present.
